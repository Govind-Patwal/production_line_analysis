# Production Line Analysis 

## Overview
A production line is a set of sequential operations established in a factory where components are assembled to make a finished article or where materials are put through a refining process to produce an end-product that is suitable for onward consumption (Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_line) )

## Use of Data Science  
Data Science/Analysis can be used to perform many types of analysis in Production line processes
1) Descriptive Analysis: What happened?
2) Diagnostic Analysis: Why did this happen?
3) Predictive Analysis: what is likely to happen in the future?
4) Prescriptive Analysis: what to do to get the desired results?

## Purpose of this Analysis
In this analysis we will focus on the quality of a output from a production line. We will run analysis 1, 2, and 3 and will try to perform Analysis 4 so that the quality can be increased.
