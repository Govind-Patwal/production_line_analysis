# Production Line Analysis 

## Overview
A production line is a set of sequential operations established in a factory where components are assembled to make a finished article or where materials are put through a refining process to produce an end-product that is suitable for onward consumption (Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_line) )

## Use of Machine Learning 
Machine Learning can be used at many points in the Production line process to do analysis of various types
1) Descriptive Analysis: What happened?
2) Diagnostic Analysis: Why did this happen?
3) Predictive Analysis: what is likely to happen in the future?
4) Prescriptive Analysis: what to do to get the desired results?
