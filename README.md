# Production Line Analysis 

## Overview
A production line is a set of sequential operations established in a factory where components are assembled to make a finished article or where materials are put through a refining process to produce an end-product that is suitable for onward consumption (Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_line) )

## Use of Data Science  
Data Science/Analysis can be used to perform many types of analysis in Production line processes
1) Descriptive Analysis: What happened?
2) Diagnostic Analysis: Why did this happen?
3) Predictive Analysis: what is likely to happen in the future?
4) Prescriptive Analysis: what to do to get the desired results?

The ultimate aim would be automation (using real-time analysis and decision making)

## POA

Dry Run 
1. Choose a test dataset closely resembling real data
2. Do the first 3 types of analysis
3. Try to prescribe next steps
4. Present the analysis

Actual Run
1. Understand the What - What is happening now, what is required from the analysis 
2. Understand the Why from the Customers and quantify the Why in terms of $$$
3. Work on the How (all 4 analysis) and show how it ties with the What, using why to help them make the emotional decision.
4. Focus on Good Presentation and POC
5. Can also suggest ML to automatically detect undesired quality output using image classification/detection

## Purpose of this Analysis
In this analysis we will focus on the quality of a output from a production line. We will run analysis 1, 2, and 3 and will try to perform Analysis 4 so that the quality can be increased.

### Step 1: Choosing a dataset for analysis
Two datasets that I found useful for analysis are
1) https://www.kaggle.com/alexkaggle95/production-quality-prediction-mae-6-954
This Dataset has the final output paramater as an integer quality score ()
2) https://www.kaggle.com/paresh2047/uci-semcom
